# Scope & Non-Claims

## What this repository provides

This repository provides:

1. **A structural checklist** to assess risks of decision centrality in AI systems ("totalization")
2. **An anti-pattern description** documenting how totalization emerges as an architectural failure mode
3. **A documented experimental protocol** for LLM self-evaluation against checklist criteria

## What we claim

- Totalization is a **structural property** that can be detected through observable patterns
- Self-evaluation protocols can reveal **stability and consistency** properties of LLM outputs
- Architectural choices influence the **concentration or distribution** of decision authority

## What we do NOT claim

**We do not claim:**

- Agency, intention, consciousness, or selfhood in LLMs
- That LLM self-evaluation provides safety guarantees
- That this framework solves alignment, governance, or ethical problems
- That totalization is inherently "good" or "bad" (it is a structural risk factor)
- That moral rules, value alignment, or behavioral constraints prevent totalization

**We do not propose:**

- Ethical frameworks or normative guidelines
- Safety mechanisms or control systems
- Governance policies or regulatory recommendations
- Solutions to AI risk or existential safety

## What we focus on

We focus on:

- **Observable behavioral properties** in system outputs
- **Structural conditions** that enable or prevent centralization
- **Evaluation protocols** that are reproducible and falsifiable
- **Design patterns** that can be analyzed and discussed

## Intended use

This framework is intended for:

- System architects and engineers conducting design reviews
- Researchers studying emergent properties of AI systems
- Evaluators assessing structural risks in deployed systems
- Teams developing evaluation methodologies

## Not intended for

- Direct implementation as safety guardrails
- Automated decision-making without human oversight
- Certification or compliance frameworks (without additional validation)
- Replacement of domain-specific risk assessment

## Epistemic status

This is **experimental work**. The checklist and protocol are proposed instruments, not validated tools. Results should be interpreted as preliminary findings requiring further investigation.
